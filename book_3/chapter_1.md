# Chapter One
## Bird DMs
Harry Potter was lowkey an oddball in sooo many ways. Like, for one, he hated summer break more than anything else. But also, he lowkey wanted to do his homework but had to do it in secret, like at midnight. Oh, and btw, he was a wizard. So, it’s nearly midnight, and he’s laying on his stomach in bed with the blankets over his head like a lil' tent, flashlight in one hand, and a big ol' book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot) propped up against the pillow. Harry's moving his eagle-feather quill down the page, super focused, trying to find something to help him finish his essay: “Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless–discuss.” He stops at this one paragraph that looks promising. Pushing his round glasses up his nose, he leans in with his flashlight closer to the book and reads: “Muggles (aka non-magic people) were super scared of magic back in medieval times but, like, didn’t know how to recognize it. So, if they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning them literally did nothing. They’d just cast a Flam Freezing Charm and pretend they were in pain, but really it was just a ticklish vibe. Wendelin the Weird literally let herself be caught 47 times because she loved being burned so much.”
